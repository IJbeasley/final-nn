However, the batch size also needed to be large enough to prevent stochasticity from inhibiting training.  I thus took inspiration from the default auto setting in sklearn's MLPRegressor function (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor.html#sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor), and initially set batch size as 200. I then measured the time it took for the model to train on my laptop, and the checked the below plot loss per epoch of training and validation. since the time it took for the model to train was not prohibitative, and the loss per epoch didn't 'bounce' around a lot, I thought this batch size was acceptable. However, in the future, performing a grid search to select a value would be ideal.   \n",

Then, for all all hidden layers, I set the activation function to be 'relu'. I chose this as 'relu' introduces sparsity which can aid neural networks in classification tasks. \n",
